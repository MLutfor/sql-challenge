# sql-challenge

The SQL script for this programs IS based on the codes provided by the in-class assignments from the U of T Data Analysis bootcamp. 

ChaGPT was also used in the assistance of debugging and refactoring the script.

The following challenge serves to do a research project about people from a fictional company employed during the 1980s and 1990s.
All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
 
Within the "Data_Analysis" folder, there are 3 folders, and 1 SQL script for the data analysis.  The SQL script "SQL Data Analysis.sql",
contain 6 tables and many queries to analyze the csv files.

The "Data Analysis Results" folder have screenshots that answer the following questions and labelled by their following numbers. 

Q1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

Q2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

Q3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

Q4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

Q5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

Q6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

Q7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

Q8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
